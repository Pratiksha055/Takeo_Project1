# Project Overview:
    A simple and responsive weather web application that allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It also supports automatic weather detection based on the user's current location using the Geolocation API.

    This weather app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches and displays weather data such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed. The app features a clean UI, error handling for invalid input, and supports both manual search and automatic location-based weather fetching.
